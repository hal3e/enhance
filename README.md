Enhance Reading and Learning


This will hopefully be a collection of exercises and games proposed by the Udemy course  [Become a SuperLearner V2](https://www.udemy.com/become-a-superlearner-2-speed-reading-memory-accelerated-learning/) and the [Keytostudy](http://www.keytostudy.com/category/goldentouch-keytostudy-main/) blog.  The puprose of the exercises is to help you develop better reading habbits and memorization. Because some of the original games were only available in flash, I decided to recreate them using HTML canvas.
