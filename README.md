Enhance Reading and Learning - [uvbakutan.github.io/enhance](https://uvbakutan.github.io/enhance)


This will hopefully be a collection of exercises and games proposed by the Udemy course  [Become a SuperLearner V2](https://www.udemy.com/become-a-superlearner-2-speed-reading-memory-accelerated-learning/) and the [Keytostudy](http://www.keytostudy.com/category/goldentouch-keytostudy-main/) blog.  The purpose of the exercises is to help you develop better reading habits and memorization. Because some of the original games were only available in Flash, I decided to recreate them using HTML canvas.

Current list of exercises:
- Mind camera game - click on the last circle that appeared
- Monkey brain - click the numbers in an ascending order
- Schulte table - focus on the red circle and find the correct number with your peripheral vision
